LevelGD is a open source terminal-based geodesic dome calculator which can be useful to develop your own 3.0 home. it is able for now, to calculate any icosahedron geodesic dome from 1V to 5V. It also has no external dependencies.

> This project was initially developed with no specific goal in mind. I originally developed it two days away from the final middle school exam in France ("Le Brevet" in french), simply because in the technology subject (IT), our teacher asked us to do a group project involving the creation of a geodesic dome, and I couldn't sleep.

# Getting the Source
You don't need to use arguments like `--recursive` because the project has no dependencies at the moment, but you will still need to install CMake to build the project. You can go to the direct link to install it by clicking [here](https://cmake.org/download/).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vertueux/levelgd.git
```

# Build the Project
These commands should be able to build the project on any platform that CMake supports, otherwise follow the instructions for each platform from the [CMake website](https://cmake.org).
```
cmake --build
make 
```

# Using the Interface
LevelGD is completely terminal-based, so you'll navigate through various choices that you select with numbers on your keyboard.
